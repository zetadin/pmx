Generate Hybrid Topology
------------------------

Example on the use of **pmx** to prepare an hybrid topology. This is after running
pdb2gmx on the mutant structure and obtaining a topology file from Gromacs.

The simplest case is the following (:download:`topol.top <topol.top>`), where
there are no itp files of other molecules included in the topology.
::

    >>> from pmx.forcefield import Topology
    >>> from pmx.alchemy import fill_bstate

    >>> # load the topology file
    >>> top = Topology('topol.top')
    >>> # fill B states for hybrid residues present
    >>> pmxtop, _ = fill_bstate(topol=top)
    >>> # write topology to a new file
    >>> pmxtop.write('pmxtop.top')


If the topology file includes different itp files (:download:`topol2.top <topol2.top>`,
:download:`topol2.itp <topol2.itp>`),
these too can be modified and returned by setting the ``recursive`` argument to ``True``. ::

    >>> # load the topology file
    >>> top = Topology('topol2.top')
    >>> # fill B states for hybrid residues present in topol2.itp
    >>> pmxtop, pmxitps = fill_bstate(topol=top, recursive=True)
    >>> # write topology and itps to a new file
    >>> pmxtop.write('pmxtop.top')
    >>> for i, itp in enumerate(pmxitps):
    >>>     itp.write('pmxitp_%s.itp' % i)


If you like getting lots of screen output, you can set the ``verbose`` argument
to ``True``. ::

    >>> pmxtop, pmxitps = fill_bstate(topol=top, recursive=True, verbose=True)
