"""**pmx** is a essentially a collection of classes and functions that allow
the manipulation of molecular structure and topolofy files. It has been thought
to be mainly used in conjunction with the Gromacs simulation package. In fact,
**pmx** makes use of some Gromacs functions to read/write trajectory data
and to allow fast neighborsearching from a python script. With time, **pmx**
has also become a library for the setup and analysis of alchemical free energy
calculations in Gromacs."""
